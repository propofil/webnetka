      <h2>What free demos are essential on the quest?</h2>
      <p>Explanations: You have just bought a MetaQuest headset and want to test VR and show it all to family and
        friends?</p>
      <p>
        So here are the free applications that I recommend to you right away :
      </p>

      <div class="ficheJeu">
        <p class="titreJeu">First steps with the Quest 2&3</p>
        <p class="descriptionJeu">
          Normally you don't have to download it because it is installed by default. In your headset, open the menu,
          click on the far right (appLibray), then click on the kind of funnel at the top (the filter) and choose
          "tutorial". And normally you should find it there.
        </p>
        <p class="descriptionJeu">
          This free app introduces you to the world of VR, and at the end offers you 2 games: a shooting game, and a
          small animation with a character who dances with you. Better to do standing up.
        </p>

      <div class="ficheJeu">
        <p class="titreJeu">Oculus First Contact</p>
        <p class="descriptionJeu">
          It's also an introduction to VR and it's very fun to make and give to those around you to "play" as a demo of
          VR.
        </p>
        <p class="descriptionJeu">
          You are in front of a cluttered office, and a small robot is going to make you do various activities. You
          trigger each step by inserting a floppy disk into the computer as it prompts you. Better to do standing up.
        </p>

      <div class="ficheJeu">
        <p class="titreJeu">First Hand</p>
        <p class="descriptionJeu">
          The experience is much shorter and less memorable, but not unpleasant
          A nice but short free demo from the AppLab!
        </p>
        <p class="descriptionJeu">
          You are going to guide a machine to make it perform an action. You will therefore operate levers, buttons....
          Better to do standing up.
        </p>

      <div class="ficheJeu">
        <p class="titreJeu">Henry</p>
        <p class="descriptionJeu">
          Henry is not a game, but a small cartoon with a lot of charm and not very long. And since it's entirely in VR,
          you're like inside the cartoon! Very cute.
        </p>
        <p class="descriptionJeu">
          Henry tells the story of a hedgehog who can't keep his friends because his quills are giving him all kinds of
          problems. There are a few scenes that I found frankly funny, and I recommend this anim for the wow effect of
          being "inside" (should be your forst experience in VR : no action, just looking).
        </p>
        <p class="descriptionJeu">
          Convient aux enfants, et il n'y a rien à faire une fois lancé. Assis ou debout
        </p>

      <div class="ficheJeu">
        <p class="titreJeu">Elixir</p>
        <p class="descriptionJeu">
          The discovery of this app and its wonderful environment is a very good memory for me. The app will teach you
          how to do without joysticks (activate manual control in the preferences and above all, then, PLACE the
          joysticks in a place where they no longer move: the game will be able to start after several long seconds of
          immobility of the joysticks)
        </p>
        <p class="descriptionJeu">
          It will also teach you a technique used in almost all quest2 apps (because it reduces motion sickness):
          teleportation. So usually, you do teleportation with the controllers, but here it explains how to do it with
          your hands: listen carefully, it will be essential to be able to play this "game".
        </p>
        <p class="descriptionJeu">
          In this funny app, we're going to do several actions by hand (in the job simulator style), after which we're
          going to observe some pretty weird phenomena on our hands^^. Do the main part of the game (the one you
          activate by placing both hands on the sensors on the screen). Then go to free mode (left side) if you want to
          go back. Magical credits accessible on the right side. Very nice world, fun experience, and very good demo to
          discover the quest 2.
        </p>
        <p class="descriptionJeu">
          Stand up. Great for children but they will have to be able to teleport (and not do anything at the risk of
          bumping themself)
        </p>
        <a href="https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3793077684043441/">Sheet on Quest store</a>

      <div class="ficheJeu">
        <p class="titreJeu">Bogo</p>
        <p class="descriptionJeu">
          As enchanting as Elixir (with slightly more difficult manipulations and requiring a little more space around)
          but much cuter: you are in a fairly wonderful world and a very cute creature asks you to pet it: teleport (
          with joystick this time) as ready as possible then reach out to caress it.
        </p>
        <p class="descriptionJeu">
          This will trigger an event, then the animal will ask you something else.
          And as you go, you will unlock 5 short activities (also think about testing all the colors for bogo).
          Beautiful.
        </p>
        <p class="descriptionJeu">
          To do standing with a little room around. Very nice for children (but a lot of manipulation to do and be
          careful not to bump into anything!)
        </p>

      <div class="ficheJeu">
        <p class="titreJeu">Bigscreen Beta</p>
        <p class="descriptionJeu">
          Here is your virtual cinema! You can watch movies (including netflix dysney channel and prime if you have
          subscriptions). Or videos on different platforms (youtube etc).
        </p>
        <p class="descriptionJeu">
          You choose your room (which can be a cinema room but also a house with home cinema etc). You can take popcorn
          and (virtual) drinks, change seats, draw in the air, listen to people commenting on the film...
        </p>
        <p class="descriptionJeu">
          The movies/videos you watch are either normal, and you have that cinema effect projected on the big screen.
          Either you have chosen 3D/360 movies and here you are, inside the movie! Note that you can put your own videos
          in your quest (simple file copy, with a usb cable) and then watch them here.
        </p>

      <div class="ficheJeu">
        <p class="titreJeu">Game demo</p>
        <p class="descriptionJeu">
          Some are limited in time (6 days max and 15 minutes of play max): ragnarok, moss and moss2, zombiland, racket
          Nx, Startenders intergalactic, Pistol whip, Deisim, the Climb 1&2... Very useful to test before possible
          purchase ; and also to discover all the activities with a quest2 (personally, I'm not attracted to shooting
          games but in VR: yes I am!).
        </p>
        <p class="descriptionJeu">
          Others can be kept and played indefinitely (creed, lost recipes,Ancient Dungeon Beta...). they make good demos
          of the quest2 for the entourage
        </p>

        <div class="ficheJeu">
          <p class="titreJeu">Free Games...</p>
          <p class="descriptionJeu">
            There are quite a few: Blaston, Bait, Population One, Echo VR, Hyper Dash, Battle Talent beta, Pavlov
            Shack...
            Some are very good, and besides, if you like multiplayer, there is no subscription for the moment on the
            quest 2 to play online

            Be careful, it's not a game; rather an experience, a mind changer. So go your way if you are looking for
            fun.
          </p>
          <p class="descriptionJeu">
            The whole 1st part is a little cryptic, but beautiful and requests rare actions (touch). Then in the last
            minutes the tone changes, realistic images appear, and you are plunged into a more cruel and striking
            reality. Or how simple keys become moving and painful to look at.

      <h2>What are the things to know about the Meta Quest 2?</h2>
      <br>
      <p>More info and a growing community on our forum(french): <a
          href="https://metaquest.forumactif.com/">metaquest.forumactif.com</a>
      <p><br>
      <h3>Help Meta Quest 2</h3>
      <a href="https://www.meta.com/fr-fr/help/quest/articles/getting-started/getting-started-with-quest-2/">Help
        page</a><br>
      <a href="https://communityforums.atmeta.com/">Forum</a><br><br>
      <h3>Buying games</h3>
      <p class="descriptionJeu">
        All games can be purchased at a reduced price: either while waiting for a discount (new one every week) or
        through the discount links (25%) given here. Please note that the 2 are not cumulative.
      </p>
      <p>Personally, I only buy on promotions at 30% or 40% (since we already have 25% off with the links, except on
        certain games under 10€ and except on expansions). And I avoid different game packs that often give you a weak
        title.
      </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h3>Mirror</h3>
      <p class="descriptionJeu">
        You can see what people are seeing in their Quest2 by syncing your smartphone app with your headphones,
        connecting both to the same wifi network, and clicking "Mirror". A red dot will appear in the player's field of
        vision.
      <p>And the one with the phone can record photos / videos, or connect his/her phone to a big screen (for example
        with usbC-hdmi cable) to allow everyone to see etc.</p>
      <p>Projecting on a computer screen or a smartTV is even easier: from your app in the quest, press menu, mirror,
        and there either your device is present and you choose it (TV, smartphone app. ..) or you choose computer and
        launch a web browser at the address "oculus.com/casting" and your image will be displayed there.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>Alternative Stores</h3>

      <p class="descriptionJeu">
        Also note that you have access with the quest 2 to all the games of the meta store (
        https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/ ), but not only: there are also alternative stores where you can go to
        find games/app, free or paid. These are games/apps still in development (alpha, beta), or that do not meet the
        criteria of the Meta store.
      <p>Have a look on the sidequest side. And know that if you possess minecraft java edition on your computer, you
        can play minecraft in VR with sidequest (after several manipulations, multiple tutorials exist) #questcraft.</p>
      </p>
      <a href="https://sidequestvr.com/">sidequest</a><br><br>
      <h3>Play computer game with MQ2</h3>
      <p class="descriptionJeu">
        But you can also play VR games that you possess on your computer (steam VR games for example), by connecting
        your quest2 by usb cable to your computer. It is then just recognized as an accessory, like a screen in fact,
        and all the work to run the game will be done by the computer (and for some demanding games, be careful, a good
        computer will be necessary).
      </p>
      <p>Virtual desktop strongly recommended to improve the resolution, optimize according to games and save
        preferences per game.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>Quest Game Optimizer</h3>
      <p class="descriptionJeu">
        QGO is essential to improve the visuals of the quest (in stand-alone use, i.e. without a pc)</p>
      <a href="https://metaquest.forumactif.com/t76-quest-games-optimizer#336">More info here (fr)</a><span> </span>
      <a href="https://anagan79.itch.io/quest-games-optimizer">or here (eng)</a>
      <p>It is sold for around $10 and is really worth it, especially since its version 7. The improvement in graphics
        is clearly visible</p>
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inE6HTKZ-ZM">Look at this video !</a><br><br>
      <h3>The blur</h3>
      <p class="gamedescription">
        It is normal to have blur on the sides because there is no auto focus: only the central area is assumed be
        perfectly clear.
        So look at this area and adjust:
        <li>✔️ the height of your helmet</li>
        <li>✔️ its tightening</li>
        <li>✔️ the spacing of the 2 eyepieces (spread your eyepieces or bring them closer and test, between the last 2
          notches for adults)</li>
      </p>
      <p>Watch out for "spots" in the viewing area. They are often due to passages of light on the side of the nose
        or through the forehead. A suitable face mask removes them. Finally, be careful to protect your lenses from the
        dust or light, to avoid irreversible stains.</p>

        We may have activated your € 30 purchase and you wonder witch game to buy firstin the MQ2 store? Here are the
        games I recommend:
        (Warning, do not force at the beginning if Motion Sickness, prefer calm games at the beginning, short sessions,
        and be careful because the effect persists at the stop at the beginning : sign that your body works to get used

          A very special game, where you ARE some Indiana Jones guys with torch and whisk in hand, physically avoiding
          traps and pitfalls.
          But it requires a lot of space, be aware you REALLY need 2x2meters as gardian area. A great VR experience but
          which can lead to falls (and sometimes sickness): be careful

          It's up to you to test the different fitness games (all have a free demo). But beware: most of them require a
          subscription (payment every month or year so). Also be aware that most of them make you practice boxing
          movements and avoidance. So take one of which it IS the specialty (Bodycombat)! And who does not ask you for a
          subscription. It is really good and offers a lot of exercises, long or short, but very physical ! And
          motivates you by competing with the other players ...

          A musical game that makes you move+++, but I don't know if everyone will like it as much as I do. I love
          typing these drums (and my battery habits come back to me). I like rock, I really take my foot in the
          sequences, and try to validate everything in Gold.
          Good achievement and good design. Test the free demo before to be convinced.

          This ping pong game is so well done... You will finally be able to play as if you had a ping pong table at
          home! (well you need a little room to move anyway!). Everything is configurable, with plenty of possible game
          modes, solo or multiplayer. A success.

          A rail shooting game based on the film Zombiland. Personally the shooting games, especially on rail, leaves me
          often indifferent. But in VR it is not the same! And then the atmosphere of the game (with the derision you
          find in the movie) is great, a lot of pleasure also to succeed in the defis of each paintings, to succeed in
          headshot and double tap ... Test the free demo before to be convinced.

          If you like cooking games on computer or smartphone (where you have to serve as many customers as possible
          with
          more and more complicated recipes), then I recommend this game, which is very well done: the decorations of
          each restaurant is very nice, we see the customers arrive, the waiter bring the dishes... Great pleasure to
          knead your dough virtually!

          It's really great to walk around the world and see it in relief (even if not all the cities are in relief)
          like a GoogleEarth; and to be able to walk in the streets with googleStreetView... We can meet up with several
          people and walk around and chat, or try to guess where we are. </p>
        <p>I also really like the Wander app even if it only does GoogleStreetView: its collections are very good and
          the navigation is smoother

          I tested Beat Sabber and Synthriders, but I prefer Audio Trip by far: the most groovy,
          the one that makes you move the most (even the lower body) and dance. 30 songs and 4 levels (easy, regular,
          cardio and expert). You'll have to move fast...

        <p class="descriptionJeu">
          So I can't recommend this game to you without testing it first, even if the demo doesn't show it under its
          best day. It's a game that is "softer" than other musical games, but it has its advantages: no
          violent movement of the arms and no need to hit virtually (mobility + soft).</p>
        <p>In hard mode, it will still raise your heart rate well and I recommend++ the community music, very easy and
          free to add <br>
          (just download them from https://synthriderz.com/beatmaps/downloader
          and put them in the Synth Riders>CustomSongs folder of your quest)
        </p>
        <p>
          Above all, in this game, you can play it in a hypnotic atmosphere. Already by activating the god mode to be
          able to
          watch without having to play. And especially by recovering the 6 very psychadelic (paid) experiences,
          as well as community Stages, on the same site (to be put this time in the file CustomStages)</p>
        <p>
          List of Experiences:
          <li>🎵 "Starlight" experience by Muse </li>
          <li>🎵 "Algorithm" experience by Muse </li>
          <li>🎵 "Underground" experience by Lindsey Stirling </li>
          <li>🎵 "Come out and play" experience by The Offspring </li>
          <li>🎵 "Wonderland" Caravan Palace</li>
          <li>🎵 "Legends Never Die" League of Legends </li>
          The Synth Riders 2021 Collection pack already contains 4 of them (I particularly like "wonderland" and "come
          out&play")
        </p>
        <p>Finally, you can customize absolutely everything in this software. Remember to test the different modes
          (spin/spiral).
          And to use the list of favourites++ (quit the game with the appropriate button)
